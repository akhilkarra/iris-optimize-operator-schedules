# Optimizing Operator Schedules for the IRIS Mission

This repository is developed and maintained by Akhil Karra and Alex Wittig, both Mathematics undergraduate students of the Class of 2026 at Carnegie Mellon University. This repository contains the Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook used to solve the scheduling problem for the IRIS Lunar Rover mission, a student-led effort by students at Carnegie Mellon University to be the first private and university group to develop, launch, and navigate a rover on the surface of the moon. [Here](https://irislunarrover.bigcartel.com) is a link to view the IRIS mission in detail.

This repository also uses a pre-commit workflow to ensure the safety, correctness, security, and legibility of code written in the Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
